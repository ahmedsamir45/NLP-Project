# üß† Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This repository contains a collection of NLP projects that explore core concepts and practical implementations in natural language processing. Each folder covers a specific topic with code and, where applicable, sample data or results.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. `data pocessing` *(Typo: should be "data processing")*
Tools and scripts for preparing raw text data. Includes:
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- Text normalization
- Handling noisy or inconsistent data

### 2. `minimum edit distance algorithm`
Implementation of the **Minimum Edit Distance** algorithm, which is commonly used in:
- Spell checkers
- Plagiarism detection
- DNA sequence analysis
- Auto-correction systems

Includes:
- Dynamic programming approach
- Cost customization (insert, delete, substitute)
- Visualization of edit operations

### 3. `text summarization`
A project focusing on extracting key information from large bodies of text.
- **Extractive summarization** using techniques like:
  - Frequency-based sentence scoring
  - TF-IDF
  - Graph-based ranking (e.g., TextRank)
- Potential for **Abstractive summarization** using pre-trained models

## üõ† Requirements

Make sure to install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìå Notes

- Python 3.7+
- Most projects use standard libraries like `nltk`, `re`, `numpy`, `pandas`
- Some may require `scikit-learn` or `networkx`
